    <h1>Heirloom Yogurt - 2 Ways!</h1>
    <p>I used to make big batches of yogurt by finding tiny plain yogurt containers with active culture at the store. These never worked well for more than a few batches. All my current batches are from <a href="https://shop.culturesforhealth.com/">Cultures for Health</a>, and I highly recommend getting cultures from them! All my cultures have been going strong for over a year. </p>
    <h2>Easiest Way: Mesophilic Culture</h2>
    <p>Mesophilic Culture doesn't turn milk into yogurt at fridge-like temperatures, but it will at most room temperatures. Easy peasy!</p>
    <h3>You need</h3>
    <ul>
<li>Glass or hard plastic container</li>
<li>A spoon of active mesophilic yogurt culture (i.e., the remainder of your last batch of mesophilic yogurt)</li>
<li>milk to fill your container</li>
<li>Optional: a thermos-like container that is slightly bigger than your yogurt container</li>        
    </ul>
    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sterilize the jar you want to make yogurt in. I'm a bit lazy about this and generally just swish boiling water around in a mason jar.</li>
        <li>If using heat for sterilization, let the jar cool.</li>
        <li>Add a small spoon of yogurt into the jar.</li>
        <li>Fill the rest of the jar with milk, leaving enough headspace that you can see the top of the milk with the lid on.</li>
        <li>Stir with a sterilized spoon to incorporate the yogurt into the milk.</li>
        <li>Put the lid on the jar.</li>
        <li>If your room temperature is chilly, like in the low 60s, I recommend putting the jar into a thermos filled with slighly warm water to create a slightly more friendly environment for the culture.</li>
        <li>Leave the culture for 8-12 hours - so leave it alone during the day or while you're sleeping.</li>
        <li>Check the jar by tilting it slightly - some cultures set very loosely, so don't jiggle it too much. You're just trying to make sure it's not plain milk anymore.</li>
        <li>Put the culture in the fridge for another 4-8 hours for it to finish setting into its final yogurt form.</li>
        <li>Enjoy! And make sure you leave a little left over to restart the process :) </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Still Easy Way: Thermophilic Culture</h2>
    <p>Thermophilic Culture needs heat to thrive. Generally it wants to be cultured at 110&#176 F, which can be achieved in a variety of ways but is easiest to achieve with a yogurt maker or an instant pot. Here I'll review how I make thermophilic yogurt in an instant pot</p>
    <h3>You need</h3>
    <ul>
<li>3-4 mason/ball jars with metal lids</li>
<li>3-4 small spoonfulls of active thermophilic yogurt culture (i.e., the remainder of your last batch of thermophilic yogurt)</li>
<li>milk to fill your containers</li>
<li>an instant pot with a trivet</li>        
    </ul>
    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sterilize the jars you want to make yogurt in by putting them on a trivet in the instant pot with about a cup of water on the bottom and setting the instant pot to steam for one minute.</li>
        <li>Let the jars cool.</li>
        <li>Add a small spoon of yogurt into each jar.</li>
        <li>Fill the rest of the jars with milk, leaving enough headspace that you can see the top of the milk with the lid on.</li>
        <li>Stir with a sterilized spoon to incorporate the yogurt into the milk.</li>
        <li>Put the lid on the jar loosely (screw finger tight and then unscrew a quarter turn).</li>
        <li>Put all jars on the trivet in the instant pot, make sure there is still water under the trivet. Add some if it needs more. The water can be above the trivet, but the jars don't need to be surrounded by water.</li>
        <li>Set the instant pot to the high yogurt setting. It defaults to an 8 hour time; I generally give mine 12+ hours as it doesn't always set by 8. It's almost always set by 10.</li>
        <li>Check the jar by tilting it slightly - some cultures set very loosely, so don't jiggle it too much. You're just trying to make sure it's not plain milk anymore.</li>
        <li>Take the jars out of the instant pot to let cool to roughly room temperature on the counter - not sure this is truly necessary but I hate putting hot things directly in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Put the culture in the fridge for another 4-8 hours for it to finish setting into its final yogurt form.</li>
        <li>Enjoy! And make sure you leave a little left over to restart the process :) </li>
