    <h1>Sauerkraut recipe from memory</h1>
    <h6><em>Please check other sources before using :)</em></h6>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cabbage</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>Juniper Berries</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely slice the cabbage and place in non-reactive bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix with more salt than you think you need.</li>
        <li>You probably didn't add enough salt. Add more salt & mix.</li>
        <li>Add juniper berries & mix. There's really no right or wrong amount here.</li>
        <li>Let sit for an hour or two.</li>
        <li>Put mixture in big jar or crock, tamping early and often.</li>     
        <li>Make sure all solids are under brine - I love the plastic-bag-filled-with-water method of weighing things down</li>  
        <li>Place in a dark place on a tray in case it overflows while bubbling.</li>
        <li>Depending on its progress and your desired level of fermentation, move to fridge in anywhere from two days to two weeks. </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
