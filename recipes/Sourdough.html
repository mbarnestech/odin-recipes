    <h1>Quick & Easy Sourdough Recipe</h1>

    <p>I love home baked bread, and over the last few years my partner and I have especially come to appreciate home-baked sourdough. There are a lot of really great recipes online and in books that I've used - this is not that. Here I'm just demonstrating some basic HTML skills. So with that in mind, here is a from-memory basic sourdough recipe. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Leaven</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5g ripe sourdough starter</li>
        <li>100g water</li>
        <li>100g flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Leaven <em> minus 5 grams removed as starter</em></li>
        <li>700g water</li>
        <li>1000g flour plus extra for shaping</li>
        <li>20g salt</li>
        <li>50g water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Shaping</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Extra flour for shaping</li>
        <li>Rice flour</li>
        <li>Masa or cornmeal</li>       
    </ul>
    <h3>Materials</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Scale</li>
        <li>Large glass or plastic bowl</li>
        <li>Two bannetons or proofing containers</li>
        <li>Sharp knife, scissors, or lame</li>
        <li>Two dutch ovens</li>
        <li>Cooling rack</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Mix the Leaven</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take a bit of ripe sourdough starter and mix it with equal parts flour and water. We only keep a very small amount of sourdough starter, so we throw all our starter in here.</li>
        <li>If you put all your starter into the leaven mix, <strong>do not forget</strong> to remove some starter from the leaven prior to mixing the dough.</li>
        <li>Proceed to the next step when the leaven has roughly doubled, smells sweet, and will float in water. We generally wait overnight.</li>
        <li>If the leaven has become very sour, you can repeat this step again. I highly recommend making <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/classic-sourdough-waffles-or-pancakes-recipe">sourdough pancakes</a> with any extra overly-mature leaven.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make the dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the leaven and 700g of water to a large glass or plastic mixing bowl. Mix thoroughly - this makes mixing the flour much easier.</li>
        <li>Add 1000g of flour to the bowl. For beginners I would recommend 80/20 white/whole wheat or a bread flour, but you can play around with the type. Mix thoroughly (don't worry about kneading, just about getting all the flour wet) and let sit for an hour.</li>
        <li>Poke a bunch of holes in the top of the rested dough with your finger. Sprinkle 20-22g salt on top, then add a tiny bit more water (10-20g). Fold & squish the dough with your fingers until the salt & water are incorporated.</li>
        <li>Fold the dough approximately every half an hour for 2-3 hours then once an hour for another 2-3 hours. Total time & intervals between folding are dependent on a whole host of things, but at the end of the day you want lots of folding because it provides structure for your bread but not <em> too</em> much because at the end you can start to knock out air bubbles.</li>
        <li>When the dough is active and doubled in size, plop it on to a floured surface and divide it into two pieces. You can fold each into a ball and bed rest them 10-20 minutes, or you can shape them into loaves.</li>
        <li>Once shaped - and you'll have to <a href="https://www.google.com">google</a> that, shaping is beyond this recipe - place each loaf in a banneton dusted with rice flour. Cover (I like to put them in an oversized plastic bag).</li>
        <li>Leave in bannetons for 1-3 hours at room temperature or refrigerated overnight.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Bake!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>30-45 minutes before baking, place the dutch ovens in the oven, empty with lids askew, and set the oven for 500&#176 F. </li>
        <li>Leave the oven heating up for at least 10 minutes after it get to temperature to make sure the dutch ovens are hot.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove the dutch ovens from the oven.</li>
        <li>Right before you place the dough in, put some masa or cornmeal in the bottom of the dutch oven to prevent the bottom of the bread from burning.</li>
        <li>Gently place the dough from the bannetons into the dutch ovens. <br>
            <ul>
                <li>The side at the bottom of the bannetons should now be facing up.</li>
                <li>If dough seams were placed at the bottom of the banneton and are now facing up, you may not need to score your bread - it will break naturally along the seams.</li>
                <li>If the side facing you in the dutch oven is smooth, score the bread with a sharp knife, scissors, or lame.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Place lids back on dutch ovens and put in oven. Immediately reduce temperature to 450&#176 F. </li>
        <li>Bake for 20 minutes, then remove lids.</li>
        <li>Bake another 20-30 minutes, until the loaves are a nice dark brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and place loaves on cooling rack.</li>
        <li>Listen to the bread do its joyous post-oven crackling.</li>
        <li>Cut immediately if you must, but the texture will be much better if you wait till it cools. Enjoy!</li>
